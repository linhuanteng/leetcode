```
# Code
Python:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        # 初始化最大利潤為 0，因為在最差情況下不交易利潤是 0
        maxP = 0  
        
        # 初始化最低購買價格為第一天的價格
        minBuy = prices[0]  

        # 遍歷價格列表
        for sell in prices:
            # 計算當前價格賣出的潛在利潤，並更新最大利潤
            maxP = max(maxP, sell - minBuy)  
            
            # 更新最低購買價格
            minBuy = min(minBuy, sell)  
        
        # 返回最大利潤
        return maxP
