# 7. Reverse Integer
[https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/)
# description
```
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
```
# Code
Python:
```python
def reverse_integer(x):
    s = -1 if x < 0 else 1  # Get the sign: -1 for negative, 1 for positive
    r = int(str(s * x)[::-1])  # Convert to positive, reverse string, convert back to integer
    return s * r if r < 2**31 else 0  # Check for overflow
```

C++:
