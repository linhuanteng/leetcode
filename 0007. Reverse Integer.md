# 7. Reverse Integer
[https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/)
# description
```
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
```
# Code
Python:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def reverse(self, x):
        # The cmp(x,y) function is used to compare two objects.
        # If x < y, it returns -1, if x == y, it returns 0, and if x > y, it returns 1.
        s = cmp(x, 0)
        r = int(`s*x`[::-1])
        return s*r * (r < 2**31)
```
