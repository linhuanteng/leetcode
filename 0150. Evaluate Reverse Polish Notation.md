# 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
# description
```
You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
There will not be any division by zero.
The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

Python:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def evalRPN(self, tokens):
        stack = []
        for t in tokens:
            if t not in "+-*/":
                stack.append(int(t))
            else:
                r, l = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
                if t == "+":
                    stack.append(l+r)
                elif t == "-":
                    stack.append(l-r)
                elif t == "*":
                    stack.append(l*r)
                else:
                    stack.append(int(float(l)/r))
        return stack.pop()
