# 0036. Valid Sudoku

# description
```
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Python:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValidSudoku(self, board):
        n = len(board)
        row_sets = [set() for i in range(n)]
        col_sets = [set() for i in range(n)]
        sub_sets = [set() for i in range(n)]

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                num = board[i][j]
                if num != ".": # Only consider filled cells
                    # i [0,2] and j [0,2] -> 0
                    # i [0,2] and j [3,5] -> 1
                    # i [0,2] and j [6,8] -> 2
                    # i [3,5] and j [0,2] -> 3
                    # i [3,5] and j [3,5] -> 4
                    # i [3,5] and j [6,8] -> 5
                    k = (i // 3) * 3 + (j // 3)  # sub-box sets index
                    # Check for duplicates in row, column, or subgrid
                    if (num in row_sets[i] or num in col_sets[j] or num in sub_sets[k]):
                        return False # Duplicate found
                    # Add number to respective sets
                    row_sets[i].add(num)
                    col_sets[j].add(num)
                    sub_sets[k].add(num)
        return True # No duplicates found; board is valid
