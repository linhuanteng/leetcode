# description
```
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
```
# Code
Python:
```python
class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        nums = set(nums)
        best = 0
        for x in nums:
            if x - 1 not in nums:
                y = x + 1
                while y in nums:
                    y += 1
                best = max(best, y - x)
        return best
